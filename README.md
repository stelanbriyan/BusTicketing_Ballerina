# Smart BusTicketing System - Ballerina


This is a modern online bus ticketing system which we are introducing to Sri Lanka
Problem : There are people who travel in buses without getting tickets
	     Sometime people don’t get change from bus conductor
	     Sometimes people do not have change/small coins to buy the bus ticket
	     People do not tend to use e-Travel cards in Sri Lanka
	     Some people are not aware of the bus routes / Travellers

Solution : we build a mobile app & a device
	     Mobile app – to purchase the bus ticket online | get more info about the Bus | info about Bus route
	     Device – a cloud storage which store data about ticket purchasing  by connecting to passenger mobiles through Bluetooth. 

How it works : when a passenger gets into a bus his mobile phone (smartphone or non-smart phone ) automatically connects with the device we fix in buses via Bluetooth. 
When it all connected passenger can get the details about the bus or the route it travels | driver & conductor details and most importantly he can pin his final destination and check how much does he has to pay for the journey and he’ll get the ETA. When he did the purchase through his bank account it gives the digital receipt as well as a SMS alert to his phone. Bus conductor needs to come & check whether all has purchased the ticket by looking at their digital receipt. 

Benefits to passenger: Do not need to bother about getting change
			 Can pay the exact amount which needed to pay
			 Can get more info about the bus & route 

Benefits to the bus owner: can get the full profit from the business
			          Chances of cheating with money collected by the bus driver & conductor is rare
